
# NASA - Nearest Earth Objects Classification with Artificial Neural Networks

## Problem Statement

In this project, binary classification attrition target (class) was estimated with the model (artificial neural networks). We tried to predict Nearest Earth Objects (NEO) class (hazardous or not). All details are in **NASA_Near_Earth_Objects-ANN_Classification.ipynb** file.

Dataset on Kaggle: [neo.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameepvani/nasa-nearest-earth-objects?select=neo.csv)
